# Waiting Primitives
# coroutine asyncio.wait(
#   aws, *, loop=None, timeout=None, return_when=ALL_COMPLETED)

# Run awaitable objects in the aws iterable concurrently
# and block until the condition specified by `return_when`.
# Returns two sets of Tasks/Futures: (done, pending).
# Usage:
#   done, pending = await asyncio.wait(aws)
# note that this function does not raise asyncio.TimeoutError.
# Futures or Tasks that aren't done when the timeout occurs
# are simply returned in the second set.

#  asyncio.as_completed(aws, *, loop=None, timeout=None)Â¶
# Run awaitable objects in the aws iterable concurrently.
# Return an iterator of coroutines. Each coroutine returned can be awaited
# to get the earliest next result from the iterable of the remaining awaitables.
